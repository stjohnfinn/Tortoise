# Tortoise

This project contains the definition for a Vagrant environment that I use 
instead of my physical host for doing sketchy things on the internet.

This project also serves as an introduction to Linux (more specifically Fedora)
hardening practices.

## Usage

`vagrant up`

then

`vagrant ssh`

then

`su - netrunner`
